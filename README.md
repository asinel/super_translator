# super_translator

A simple Flutter app using Google Translator API

## Getting Started

This project uses Google Translate Cloud API, so you need to have API key

Create a .env file in the root of the project, and paste it there:
`GOOGLE_API_KEY=AIzaXXXXXXXXXXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX`

## Supported platforms
This app runs on Android, iOS, and Web.

## Additional features
Besides covering error and low-connectivity cases, I've added feature to refetch failed translation only with one button whenever.
